### "I see demo data instead of my data"

1. **Private key format issue**: Make sure your `GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY` has actual line breaks replaced with `\n`
2. **Spreadsheet not shared**: Double-check you shared your sheet with the service account email
3. **Wrong spreadsheet ID**: Verify you copied the correct ID from your URL

**Quick fixes:**
1. Visit `your-dashboard-url.vercel.app/api/debug` to see what's configured
2. Check that all three environment variables show as "true"
3. Make sure your service account has "Editor" access to your sheet

### "Dashboard won't load"

1. Check your internet connection
2. Try refreshing the page
3. Clear your browser cache
4. Try a different browser

### "Data isn't updating"

1. Wait 10-15 minutes after updating your sheet
2. Try hard-refreshing (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Check that your sheet updates are being saved

### "Colors look weird"

Make sure your Status column uses these exact words (case-sensitive):
- Applied
- Screening  
- Interviewing

- Rejected
- Ghosted
